# Grailed Fee Calculator

This Python project is a simple calculator for determining the commission and processing fees charged by Grailed, a popular online marketplace for buying and selling men's fashion. The calculator is hosted on Streamlit, a platform for creating and sharing data apps.

In addition to calculating the commission and processing fees, this calculator also displays the adjusted selling price, which is the total price minus the commission and processing fees.

# Example: How to use it

Simply, type your selling price, select calculate, and it'll display your adjusted selling price.
